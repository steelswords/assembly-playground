# Assembly Playground

This is a collection of assembly programs I have written by hand to keep my assembly
and low-level programming skills sharp.

All the programs in this repo are designed to run in an x86\_64 architecture with
the System V ABI. They have been tested in a modern Linux environment, specifically
Pop!_OS, a Debian-based distrobution.

# To Build
CMake makes the build process really easy:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
